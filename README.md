# Continual Learning

---
## Abstract
The aim of this project is to study the effects of 3 continual learnign methods such as :
- REPLAY METHODS
- REGULARIZATION METHODS
- PARAMETER ISOLATION METHODS

On a 3D object classification task.
Using one kind of model from the Avalanche library.

For each CL method will be developed some of the techniques suggested by the paper

We will use more than one neural network model , stacked by the network complexity 
- SMALL 
- MEDIUM 
- LARGE
